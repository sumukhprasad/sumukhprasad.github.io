		<h2>At a Glance</h2>
		
		<b>Research/Professional Interests</b><br>
		On the pure research side, I'm interested in human-computer interaction, distributed systems, electoral and electronic voting systems, and adjacent fields. Or, generalising a bit,
		<ul>
			<li>If computer science can be thought of as a field of abstractions,</li>
			<ul>
				<li>How can abstractions be made inspectable and explorable?</li>
				<li>How do we optimally decide how much information abstractions reveal to whom?</li>
				<li>How can we help people practically understand these abstractions?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>How do interfaces shape what people can see, know, and do?</li>
			<li>How can we design systems that are legible to a broad spectrum of people?</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<br>
		On the more practical side, I'm interested in Cocoa/macOS development, OS and kernel development, technology in education and computers for kids, interactive learning demonstrations for complex topics, and free-and-open-source everything.
		
		<br><br>
		
		<b>Other Miscellaneous Interests</b><br>
		Indian classical languages, topical linguistics, Indian classical music, mathematical visualisations, etc.

		<h2>Languages, Frameworks, and Tools</h2>
		
		I have a working proficiency in several programming paradigms, including systems-level languages (C/C++, minimal x86 assembly), high-level scripting (Python, Processing, Julia), web development (JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, PHP), object-oriented languages (Java, Swift), and document preparation systems (LaTeX).
		
		<br><br>
		I have some experience working with popular technologies like p5.js, node.js, D3, OpenCV, postgres, and Unix- and Linux-based environments.
		
		I have experience in web development with many popular frameworks including Svelte, React, Jekyll, django, Ruby on Rails, EmberJS, etc.
		
		<br><br>
		While I know how to use many technologies, over time I have come to value simplicity and information density over pomp and show, which is why I usually roll my own mini-frameworks for my projects. Often, I find that the most simple solutions are most likely to be the most elegant ones, and those are the kinds of solutions I gravitate toward.
