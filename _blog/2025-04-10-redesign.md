## First, Why?
> Creating your own online presence is a tough job. When you're both client and designer, the highest standards apply. It has to be top notch, unique and inspiring on every level.

This was the basis for me redesigning this website. The old one was sleek and clean, sure, but it lacked the charm I wanted it to have. I've always loved those old-web blogs that seem to have some character to them, like [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net), [The Blogess](https://thebloggess.com), [Michael Tsai](https://mjtsai.com) and a whole host of others — so I wanted to have some of that charm shine here as well.

<br>
## Georgia on my mind (... and Verdana too, maybe)
One of the first things I did was to take out the Lato, Source Serif, and IBM Plex Mono fonts in favour of Georgia, Verdana, and Courier New. I have nothing against those fonts, heck, they're still my favourite fonts to use on other projects — but I wanted to keey this site "classic," so to speak. They scream "old web" but in a warm, unpretentious way — these fonts are web-safe and will still render beautifully on basically everything.

<br>
## Theme color
Now there's a theme colored body that replaces the white nothingness of yore. It's subtle, but it serves to emphasize the 640px content width and also makes it feel a lot more cozier and less like a printout.

<br>
## Pagination
This one's purely for technical reasons, end of reasons. I am not interested in an unmanagable list of links.

<br>
## Dates before titles
Purely for the aesthetic. Again, charm is what I'm going for. Also I don't know, it just feels more *blog-ish* to me for some reason.

At the end of the day, it's not beautiful that I'm after — I want a place on the web that feels like me and not a prim-ified me.
