It's wild how someone who shaped our digital world so deeply stayed out of the general public's spotlight. The marching ant selection boxes we take for granted, selection lassos, the menu bar, the idea of using a computer as a canvas, the slick user interfaces on Macs that have inspired so many for so long... all carry his legacy. He didn't just build things â€” he made them feel human. Fun and beautiful and creative, even.

Unfortunately though, pancreatic cancer has taken from us yet another pioneer.

_Rest in peace._
