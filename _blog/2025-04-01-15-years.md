As I walk away from the school I've stepped into every morning for the past 15 years, there's a tinge of bittersweet emotion. There's immense gratitude, and a little disbelief, that 15 years have come to an end -- and perhaps too has the first chapter of my life.

DPS Bangalore South, over the years, has become the epicentre of what has made me, me. Every small odd job I did around the classroom, somehow being the only 10th grader in the school council, leading the Atal Lab for 2 years, being a Peer Educator, making my way up to President of the IT Council... every one of these experiences has been incredibly instrumental in making me who I am.

For all the incredible teachers, the friends who became family, the experiences and opportunities, I have immense gratitude for this institution. I suppose no matter where life takes me, I'll always carry a piece of this school with me.

While one chapter draws its curtains, another one is opening up, right around the corner. Here's to the next one, and the next, and the one after that... you get the idea.
