	<h1>Grapher</h1>

	This is a web-based grapher for equations in 2 variables.
	To use the grapher, download the code and open `index.html`

	This program can handle any equation (linear or not) in 2 variables, and is relatively fast. It also allows you to save your graphs as a PNG file.

	<h2>Features:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Infinite equations (CPU's the limit!)</li>
		<li>Draggable points on the graph (Use the "Points" button to enable them)</li>
		<li>Equation Trees (To see how your equation was understood by the program, click the (i) button next to the equation.)</li>
	</ul>

	Finally, this is only a hobby program I made, and it's by no means anywhere near <a href="https://www.desmos.com">Desmos</a>. Just enjoy it. This isn't meant for serious work.

	<h2>Addendum</h2>
	
	This was the first "real" piece of software I ever made, way back when I was still in 9th grade. So by most standards it's pretty rough around the edges.
