	<h1>Create with Computers</h1>
	
	<p>"Create with Computers" was a talk given by Mr. Prasanth Nori (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.prasanthnori.com/">prasanthnori.com</a>) of the Scratch team at DPS Bangalore South.</p>
	
	<p>Mr. Nori walked the students through a problem solving session on Scratch and taught them how to approach problems with the right mindset, by using the example of making a sprite walk from left to right. He also introduced them to Scratch Labs, where students can use experimental Scratch features such as video sprites and face recognition.</p>
